# AVL_Library

Takes the book name, author, and ISBN from a book and inputs the book into an AVL tree. The AVL tree automatically checks for imbalances and adjusts according to how the data structure normally works and eventually outputs the books in order also outputting the imbalances and rotations to fix it.
